# Handoff

Write a handoff document summarising the current conversation so a fresh agent can continue the work.

This is the operational skill for Methodrail's **handoff** context transition. It is explicit-only. See [context management](../../references/context-management.md) for when to continue, clear, isolate, handoff, or compact.

## Where to write it

Save to the temporary directory of the user's OS, not the current workspace, unless the user asked for a project-local artifact. A handoff is a travel document, not a durable project record.

If the next agent is another session in this same checkout and nothing needs to travel, prefer continue, clear, isolate, or compact instead.

## What to include

Carry only the live thread:

- intent of the current work
- what is already decided
- open frontier / next action
- relevant evidence pointers
- suggested skills the next agent should load

If the user passed arguments, treat them as a description of what the next session will focus on and tailor the doc accordingly.

## What not to duplicate

Do not duplicate content already captured in other artifacts. Reference them by path or URL:

- specs, plans, ADRs, issues
- commits, diffs
- `.methodrail/PROJECT.md` and linked knowledge
- decision records, observation records, verification evidence

The next agent should reload those artifacts rather than reading a copy.

## Redaction

Redact API keys, passwords, tokens, and personally identifiable information.

## Completion

A fresh agent can continue from the document plus the referenced artifacts, without the previous conversation, and without duplicated durable state.

## Neighbors

- Often follows: long `develop` / `debug` / `investigate` sessions, `prototype` round-trips
- May produce input for: the next session's workflow skill
- Do not combine automatically with: `compact` as a substitute, or `reflect` unless learning candidates are in scope
- Must not: copy specs/ADRs into the handoff, or write secrets
